      <title>Call for Volunteers</title>
      <link>http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/36</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With just ten days until the start of PyCon Australia 2012, it’s time
for us to call for volunteers -- we need your support to make PyCon AU a
huge success. Over the course of the conference we will be needing
session chairs, people to man the registration desk and general volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session chairs and only need to commit to being in one room
between two breaks (e.g. from the end of morning tea through the
beginning of lunch).  You can take up these roles and still see all of
the talks in one room for a session -- just nominate which sessions
you'd be happy to chair in your reply and we'll try to allocate you to
them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Session chairs are responsible for managing one room for a block of
presentations between two breaks. Their job is to:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce the speakers
&lt;li&gt;Keep speakers on time
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the session is kept in order
&lt;li&gt;Passing the audience microphone to questioners (this helps make sure
our video recordings are of a very high quality).
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our registration desk will be open on Friday night and Saturday
morning (&lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/programme/registration&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/programme/registration&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need four volunteers to make short work of the 200+ delegates that
we are expecting. Outside of those rush hours we’d like to keep the
desk manned to answer delegate queries and deal with late check-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, any volunteers who can be on call throughout the conference
to assist the organisers would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who can make it, we plan on running a briefing session on
Friday afternoon, sometime around 3:30pm (time to be confirmed).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in volunteering for any of the roles that we've
described above, please reply to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:contact@pycon-au.org&quot;&gt;contact@pycon-au.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PyCon Australia dinner cruise and reception</title>
      <link>http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/33</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We're very pleased to be able to announce the final, hitherto unannounced part of PyCon Australia 2012 -- our conference dinner this year is being held offsite at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peppermintbay.com.au&quot;&gt;Peppermint Bay&lt;/a&gt;, near Woodbridge, some 30km to the south of Hobart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; padding: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/images/page_images/peppermint_bay_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;Peppermint Bay&quot;&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the waterfront location of our conference venue, we'll be starting the evening with a one-hour twilight cruise on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.derwentrivercruises.com.au/vessels.html&quot;&gt;Navigators catamaran, MV Marana&lt;/a&gt; (with your choice of indoor seating, or outdoor viewing decks); following the cruise, Peppermint Bay will present a three-course dinner, featuring fresh produce from the local region and around Tasmania.  Once that's done, we'll take you back to Wrest Point aboard the Marana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope the dinner will be an excellent centrepiece of the conference this year, which will help make PyCon Australia 2012 a memorable event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about our dinner cruise and reception, or PyCon Australia in general, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/programme/dinner&quot;&gt;see our website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a conference is nothing without people attending, and there's still plenty of opportunity to join in the fun.  Registrations for the conference will remain open until the week of the conference, or until we sell out; but if you want one of our fantastic conference t-shirts, you'll need to have your registration finalised on Tuesday, 31 July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices for reigstrations start at $44 for students, and $198 for individuals.  You can register at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/prices&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;More Events!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you attending the conference, you'll be pleased to know that we've confirmed a few more of our events for the conference.  The annual PyLadies breakfast is happening on the Saturday, before conference festivities start, at Wrest Point's Pier One waterfront restaurant.  This event is open to all female delegates to the conference, and is being sponsored by our good friends at Google Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our conference venue, Wrest Point, has a number of hotel rooms
reserved for PyCon Australia delegates, at guaranteed prices.  These
are good value-for-money, and are all very close to the conference
rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rates will only be guaranteed for delegates who reserve their
rooms on or before Tuesday 17 July 2012.  For details of prices, room
types, and how to book, see our website at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/accommodation&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/accommodation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reserve your room, one night's (refundable) deposit must be paid on
reservation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Conference Registration -- Register by Tuesday 31 July to guarantee
your t-shirt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference registrations will be open until just before the conference
kicks off, unless we sell out earlier.  However, we need final numbers
for our t-shirt supplier at the start of August.  So, if you want your
conference t-shirt, please register before Tuesday 31 July!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tower (Mountain View) (4.5 stars): $135/night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tower (Harbour View) (4.5 stars): $163/night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suite (4.5 stars): $228/night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there are limited numbers of Mountainside rooms remaining.  All rooms are available on a single, double or twin-share basis, with extra beds available for $35/night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details, sample room photographs, and booking instructions, see our web site at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/accommodation&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/accommodation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bookings made under our original guaranteed rates &lt;strong&gt;will be discounted to reflect these new rates&lt;/strong&gt;, including refunds of room deposits on checkout if applicable.

      <title>PyCon Australia 2012 Conference Programme Revealed!</title>
      <link>http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/27</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Hobart Tasmania, 15 June 2012) With both of our keynotes announced, PyCon Australia is very proud to be able to reveal the programme for the 2012 conference, to be held on Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 August 2012 in Hobart, Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following an impressive response to our Call for Proposals the conference will feature three full tracks of presentations and tutorials, across two days, covering all aspects of the Python ecosystem, presented by experts and core developers of key Python technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our keynote presenters, &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/24&quot;&gt;Mark Ramm, Engineering Manager on Juju at Canonical&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/18&quot;&gt;Kenneth Reitz, Python lead at Heroku&lt;/a&gt; will be joined by a wide array of presenters covering a broad range of backgrounds, including industry, research, government and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, PyCon Australia is a great place to keep up-to-date with the latest trends in Python web technology: From Heroku, Lincoln Stoll will be presenting on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/schedule/59/view_talk?day=sunday&quot;&gt;12 Factor Method for building software-as-a-service apps&lt;/a&gt;. Other web related topics include deployment and testing techniques for Django applications and techniques for asynchronous web programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's also a wide range of talks for the rapidly growing community of developers using Python in science.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/schedule/67/view_talk?day=saturday&quot;&gt;Edward Schofield's survey of the latest developments in Python for Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt; will get you up to scratch on what tools and techniques are shaping the Python world for scientists.  From there, case studies and introductory talks will delve into all aspects of Python in science: including techniques for handling large scientific data sets, natural language processing, and data visualisation -- attendees working with Python in all fields of science will gain something from PyCon Australia 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for newcomers to Python looking to quickly enhance their Python skillset, &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/schedule/56/view_talk?day=saturday&quot;&gt;Graeme Cross' tutorials&lt;/a&gt; in our Classroom stream will help you to rapidly enhance your knowledge of Python -- you can then attend our general stream talks to glean a snapshot of the state of the art in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia 2012 programme committee chair, Richard Jones, was impressed with the level of response to the Call for Proposals, which closed in early May: &lt;em&gt;&quot;We had an unprecedented response to our Call for Proposals this year, and this has helped us to put together one of the strongest programmes ever at PyCon Australia. There's something for every developer working with Python in this year's programme -- be they working in web technology, in research, or even if they're just a Python enthusiast who wants to learn more about their favourite language.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full schedule for PyCon Australia 2012 can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registrations for PyCon Australia 2012 are now open, with prices starting at AU$44 for students, and tickets for the general public starting at AU$198.  All prices include GST, and more information can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/prices&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're looking forward to seeing this excellent programme brought to life at PyCon Australia 2012, in Hobart, in August.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mark Ramm joins PyCon Australia 2012 as a Keynote Presenter</title>
      <link>http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/24</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia, the national conference for the Python programming community is happy to announce that veteran Python web developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://compoundthinking.com/blog&quot;&gt;Mark Ramm&lt;/a&gt; will be joining the 2012 conference as a keynote presenter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia 2012 will be held in Hobart, Tasmania on Saturday 18 and Sunday 19 August, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/daninrgb/3405945302/&quot; title=&quot;Mark Ramm by daninrgb, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3664/3405945302_b0bc82ba32.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Mark Ramm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do the tools of the scientist meet the tools of product design for high-growth Startups? Mark explains: &lt;em&gt;&quot;There’s been a lot of buzz about 'Lean Startups,' 'Customer Development,' 'Business Model Generation' and related topics lately, and there is a real transformation in the way we design and build products at work behind all that buzz -- the fundamental principle behind all of them is applying scientific and experimental methodologies to product design decision making.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Fortunately Python is a great tool for those looking to apply data science to product design.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mark's previous role as Director of Engineering at &lt;a href=&quot;http://SourceForge.net&quot;&gt;SourceForge.net&lt;/a&gt;, he set out to prove the value of these tools in an established organisation, eventually transforming their development practices, and the entire SourceForge.net product around it, to help them meet the needs of their users quicker.  He now works as Engineering Manager on the Juju team at Canonical, helping developers rapidly deploy services to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A regular presenter at Python-related conferences around the world, including PyCon US, EuroPython, Kiwi PyCon and OSCON; Mark is also the co-BDFL of the TurboGears web framework, and is a regular contributor to the Pyramid ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're looking forward to hearing Mark's guide to developing startups with the tools of the scientist in August.  Conference registrations are now open at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/prices&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heroku's Kenneth Reitz to present keynote at PyCon Australia 2012</title>
      <link>http://2012.pycon-au.org/media/news/18</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Early Bird registrations well underway, PyCon Australia is very pleased to announce &lt;a href=&quot;http://kennethreitz.com&quot;&gt;Kenneth Reitz&lt;/a&gt; of Heroku as the first of its keynote speakers for the 2012 conference, to be held on August 18 and 19 in Hobart, Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennethreitz/5246672207/&quot; title=&quot;Kenneth Reitz by kennethreitz, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5241/5246672207_8506a6a53d_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; alt=&quot;Kenneth Reitz&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world of software development turns to making things more usable for end-users of applications, making libraries and APIs easy for developers themselves to use often becomes an afterthought.  Even in the Python world, many key APIs are a pain to work with. &lt;em&gt; &quot;Unfortunately, solving simple problems with Python isn't always 'import antigravity'. Best practices are sometimes far from obvious.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, says Kenneth.  &lt;em&gt;&quot;My keynote will analyse the high barriers of entry that clutter the Python landscape, and I'll be discussing ways to make Python more accessible for newcomers and less of a headache for seasoned veterans.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Kenneth's shining successes in making formerly difficult tasks easier for Python developers is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests&quot;&gt;Requests HTTP library&lt;/a&gt; (python-requests): a tool that has transformed making HTTP requests in Python from a cumbersome and error-prone task into one that's elegant, easy to understand and easy to remember.  Such is the success of Requests, it is now considered the de facto way of making HTTP requests in Python.  python-requests is now the third most-watched Python project on GitHub, second only to projects from Facebook and Django.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth is now working with Heroku, overseeing the technical design of their Python application stack.  Kenneth's other popular open source projects include Legit, Clint, Python-Guide, HTTPbin, Inbox.py, OSX-GCC-Installer, and more available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/kennethreitz&quot;&gt;http://github.com/kennethreitz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We at PyCon Australia can't wait to hear Kenneth's insights on improving the Python ecosystem in August!  Registration is open at &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.pycon-au.org&quot;&gt;http://2012.pycon-au.org&lt;/a&gt; with Early Bird rates available to the first 60 paid delegates, or until Friday 1 June, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
